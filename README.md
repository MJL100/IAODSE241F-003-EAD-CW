EAD Course Work - School Management System
School Management System - St. Sebastian's College
About the Project
This School Management System was developed as part of the Enterprise Application Development (EAD) coursework. It is a functional application designed to manage key school operations, including student profiles, teacher assignments, and class details. The system is specifically tailored for St. Sebastian's College, though it was created independently without the official knowledge of the institution.

The application includes a Login Page (JFrame Form) that connects directly to a MySQL database, ensuring secure authentication for users.

Login Page (JFrame Form)
The system includes a Login Page built using Java Swing (JFrame Form), which is connected to a MySQL database for user authentication.

Default Login Credentials:
Username: admin
Password: admin
Note: These credentials are stored in the MySQL database and are used to access the system. It is recommended to change these default credentials after the initial login for security purposes.

Purpose and Scope
The project showcases the practical application of enterprise application development concepts and database integration. It provides a functional system for school operations, serving as a model for similar real-world applications.

Future Enhancements
Adding user roles (e.g., admin, teacher, student) with role-based access control.
Integration with cloud services for backup and scalability.
Real-time notifications for updates on fees and reports.
This system demonstrates how enterprise-level applications can optimize school operations. By integrating a login system directly linked to a MySQL database, it ensures secure and efficient access management.
